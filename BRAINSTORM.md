# Puppet module requirements

## Use parameters

By rule, no user of your module should need to touch any code to change
configuration. An example in it's most primitive form:

Bad:

```puppet
  class x::params {
    $foo = 'bar'
  }
```

Good:

```puppet
  class x::params (
    $foo = 'bar'
  ) {
    $package = $::operatingsystem ? {}
  }

  class x {
    require x::params
    $foo = $::x::params::foo
  }

```

Better:

```puppet
  class x::params(
    $foo = 'bar',
    $os_dep = undef,
  ) {
    $_os_dep = $os_dep ? {
      undef    => $::operatingsystem ? {
        /(?i:centos|redhat)/  => 'redhat_dep',
        default               => 'default_dep',
      },
      default  => $os_dep,
    }
  }

  class x (
    $foo    = $::x::params::foo,
    $os_dep = $::x::params::_os_dep,
  ) inherits ::x::params  {

    # VICTORY, I CAN OVERLOAD VARIABLES GLOBALLY, AND CLASS SPECIFIC!!

  }

```
## sanity checks

Check requirements on top of your class as much as possible
Do a case statement to check for whatever you need to check and fail
if something is unsupported.

Every fail you use should be mentioned in the docs ofcourse.


## Don't configure repositories.

You can list your required repositories as a requirement in your fine
documentation, but don't force system admins to use a specific repository.
In an environment where you need more control over installed packages, this
can be a mess to deal with.

You can however include a definition for a repository, but don't include it
by default. Allow the user to choose to do so.

## Don't use hiera functions in your modules

People should not depend on hiera to use your module. And they should be free to use the hiera variables they want.

Hiera should be used at manifest-level (or inside "meta-modules") and never in generic modules.

## Other stuff you should pay attention to

* Always depend on the alias of a package, but not on the class that installs that package.
* Include the following header in your templates files, taking that the target file supports some kind of commenting.

```erb
### File managed with puppet ###
## Served by:        '<%= scope.lookupvar('::servername') %>'
## Module:           '<%= scope.to_hash['module_name'] %>'
## Template source:  '<%= template_source %>'
```

## Stuff to think about

How are we going to version the hieradata folder?


## puppet.conf directives I should remember in case I ever need them

dynamicfacts:
  Facts that are dynamic; these  facts  will  be  ignored  when  deciding
  whether  changed  facts  should  result  in a recompile. Multiple facts
  should be comma-separated.

  Default: memorysize,memoryfree,swapsize,swapfree



templatedir:
  Where Puppet looks for template files. Can be a list of colon-seperated
  directories.

  Default: $vardir/templates
