This is a braindump / work in progress to tackle some of the more difficult

If you have any ideas, feel free to add them.

# Components

## Vagrant

I included my Vagrantfile so you can easily test it without a hastle.
For now, there is not a lot of functionality (none) to test with thou.

## BRAINSTORM

Feel free to add anything in here. Make sure to add motivation if you change
something. Once we sort some stuff out, we will move it to the appropriate
document.

## PUPPET-TREE-LAYOUT

A overview on how a the perfect puppet tree may look like.

## CI

Tools, tips, tricks on how to work out a continuous integration platform for
a puppet tree. Mostly based on jenkins for now.
